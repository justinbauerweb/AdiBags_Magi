#  Magi's Custom AdiBags Filters
- Filters that span across all expansions
- Filters things that I find useful to be more organized
- Tries to not arbitrarily create categories, for categories-sake (only relevant categories within each expansion)
- A number of custom overrides to default filtering
- Includes Color-coded filter names (with thoughtful color choices)
- Filters use real categories (like Equipment and Tradeskill)
- No custom options (you can't turn anything off/on)
